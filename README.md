# zoom

## Description

'zoom' is a small command line tool for getting quick info about Formula One. It uses the Ergast Developer API (http://www.ergast.com/mrd) to obtain relatively up to date info.

## Commands

At the moment, zoom can be run from the 'run.sh' script included however I plan to make it installable in some way. Currently there are two commands arguments you can pass zoom: 'next-race' and 'results'. The former will show the name, date and time of the next F1 Grand Prix and the latter will show the results of the last Grand Prix.

## Note

This is mainly an exercise in Scala rather than a practical tool so don't expect anything magical...
